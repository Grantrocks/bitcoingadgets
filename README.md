## Bitcoin Gadgets

This is a very secure and simple bitcoin wallet that has some useful tools inside.

## Installing

To install this wallet you need to download the source code or by git. You then need to navigate to the downloaded folder in your terminal and run the following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That will download all of the needed files for your wallet

## Usage

To use the wallet run main.py with python and the wallet will open up. You can do stuff in it by following the prompts.

## Do not close the wallet without using CTRL+C or q. This will make it so that your wallet is forever encrypted and you cant get in to it. Just in case this happens write down your seed. I will remove this soon.
